======

1. [daarem](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/daarem/index.html) An R package implementing the "DAAREM"" method for accelerating the convergence of slow, monotone sequences from smooth, fixed-point iterations such as the EM algorithm

2. [AFTrees](https://github.com/nchenderson/AFTrees) An R package for analysis of heterogeneous treatment effects that utilizes nonparametric AFT models that have additive tree structures for the regression function.

3. [rvalues](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rvalues/index.html) An R package for computing "r-values" for ranking a large collection of units. Each unit is assumed to have an effect size estimate and an associated standard error.

4. [DelayedSurvFit](https://github.com/nchenderson/DelayedSurvFit) An R package for conducting survival comparisons of two treatments when one suspects a delayed treatment effect.

5. [shrinkcbp](https://github.com/nchenderson/shrinkcbp) An R package that computes the "compromise best predictor" (CBP). The CBP can be thought of as a collection of robust shrinkage estimates of small domain parameters and is an alternative to more traditional mixed model-based BLUPs.
